# FindX11_XCB
# -----------
#
# Try to find the X11 XCB compatibility library.
#
# This will define the following variables:
#
# ``X11_XCB_FOUND``
#     True if (the requested version of) libX11-xcb is available
# ``X11_XCB_VERSION``
#     The version of libX11-xcb (this is not guaranteed to be set even when
#     X11_XCB_FOUND is true)
# ``X11_XCB_LIBRARIES``
#     This can be passed to target_link_libraries() instead of the ``EGL::EGL``
#     target
# ``X11_XCB_INCLUDE_DIR``
#     This should be passed to target_include_directories() if the target is not
#     used for linking
# ``X11_XCB_DEFINITIONS``
#     This should be passed to target_compile_options() if the target is not
#     used for linking
#
# If ``X11_XCB_FOUND`` is TRUE, it will also define the following imported
# target:
#
# ``X11::XCB``
#     The X11 XCB compatibility library
#
# In general we recommend using the imported target, as it is easier to use.
# Bear in mind, however, that if the target is in the link interface of an
# exported library, it must be made available by the package config file.
#
# Since pre-1.0.0.
